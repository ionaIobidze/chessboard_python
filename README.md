# Chess Game

This is a simple implementation of a chess game in Python using object-oriented programming. The game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

## Features

- Classic chess rules are implemented, including pawn promotion, castling, check, and checkmate.
- The GUI allows players to make moves by clicking on the board.
- The game visually displays the chessboard and pieces.
- Check and checkmate conditions are detected and displayed.

## Getting Started

To run the game, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Clone or download the repository to your local machine. Navigate to the project directory and run the run.py file.
This will launch the game's graphical interface, and you can start playing chess right away.

## How to Play

- Click on a piece to select it.
- Click on one of the legal moves to move the selected piece to that square.
- If it's your turn, make moves to capture your opponent's pieces and put their king in checkmate to win the game.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (should be included in most Python installations)
